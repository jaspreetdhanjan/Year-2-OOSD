# Year-2-OOSD
Final assessment piece for Object-Orientated Systems Development where I received 95% (A+).

The goal of this assignment was to produce an alternative to the blackbox system that airplanes currently use. My proposed application was a client/server system where the client (airplane) would transmit data to a server entity (airtraffic controller). I had to use C++ alongside Object-Orientated principles in my project.
