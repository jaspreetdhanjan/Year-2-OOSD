# Object-Orientated Systems Development Project â€“ AirViewer

The goal of this assignment was to produce an alternative to the blackbox system that airplanes currently use. My proposed application was a client/server system where the client (airplane) would transmit data to a server entity (airtraffic controller). I had to use C++ alongside Object-Orientated principles in my project.

I ended up doing well for this assessment and recieved 95% for the application overall.
